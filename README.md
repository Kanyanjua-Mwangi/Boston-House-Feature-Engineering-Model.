The Boston Housing Dataset is a seminal resource in machine learning, offering rich insights into housing dynamics in Boston suburbs.
Our project focuses on leveraging this dataset to develop a predictive model for housing prices. 
Beginning with data exploration, we dissect each feature to discern its significance in property valuation.
We will engage in feature engineering to refine attributes and align them with underlying data patterns.
we employ advanced machine learning techniques to construct predictive models tailored to the Boston housing market.
our aim is to create a model that forecasts housing prices accurately and explores the driving factors behind property values.
